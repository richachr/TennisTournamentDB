# TennisTournamentDB

A service to create tennis tournament brackets that can be updated as teams come and go, allowing for late arrivals and early departures. Statistics can also be tracked at the player and team level.

# ERD
Sketch your initial thinking on your ERD and the data your project will be accessing and using

# Data

This database system may be tested during development on actual tennis match data, but the goal of the project is that the data will be provided by the enduser as they utilize the service for the tournament they're managing.

# Technologies
TTDB will run on a web frontend built on Javascript and React, with a backend using Node.js and SQLite. The database will be stored and managed in separate instances for each user.

# Timeline Goals

*3/19*: Finish project plan and diagrams.

*3/26* Finish basic SQLite feature development.

*4/2* Finish logical testing and add additional statistical features.

*4/9* Implement frontend system to interact with database.

*4/16* Refine frontend design, test database logic, and fix bugs.

# UI

The detail and scale of the UI will be largely determined by time constraints unrelated to the project, and may be as basic or as sophisticated as time allows. The current plan is to have no login, a simple and visually pleasing UI in React, no persistent storage, and options for exporting the results of the tournament for user convenience.
